# Django Tutorial Project
This is just the stuff I done while following the Django introductory tutorial.
The end result is an app that polls users and records the results.
## What you need to run this
- Python
- Django
- A MySQL or MariaDB server

You can run the MySQL/MariaDB server in a VM if you want, or on a big boy server.
You will need to create a file "tutorialsite/.env", and give it these values:

- SECRET_KET = (Ask me for this one or generate your own)
- DATABASE_NAME = (The name of the database you will use)
- DATABASE_HOST = (The IP of the database server)
- DATABASE_PORT = (The port the database runs on)
- DATABASE_USER = (The user on the database which you will connect as)
- DATABASE_PASSWORD = (The user's password)

If you need any help with any of these things, just ask me and I'll point you in
the right direction (if you're a member of this group and/or I know you).
